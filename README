NoNewContent is an echo server (see RFC 862 for the echo protocol). It
is intended as a research project and is not probably suitable for use
on the wild Internet.

The official source is <http://github.com/bortzmeyer/nonewcontent>

Usage
*****

./nonewcontent [-address="[ADDRESS]:PORT"] 

Run with -h to see the defaults (and the other, less common, options)

The -address option takes either a port (in the syntax ":NNN"), in
that case NoNewContent listens on all IP addresses, or one address (in
the syntax "x.y.z.T:NNN" for IPv4 and "[xxxx:yyyy::zzzz]:NNN" for
IPv6). If you want to listen on some (but not all) of the IP
addresses, separate them with commas, for instance
"-address=127.0.0.1:8001,[2001:db8::FADA]:8003".

For the person who compiles
**************************

You need a working Go <http://golang.org> environment. Today, only the
gc compiler is supported.

Then, just type:

make


Implementation notes
********************

One goroutine is run for every echo request. Makes the code much
simpler and easier to read.

TODO
****

Use the log package?

Test with gccgo

Daemonize <http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/browse_thread/thread/2b29d93b90501a4b/95242bfb7ae0549e>
